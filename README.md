# null

If you ever come up with something to share, but have no appropriate listeners, try [`null.sh`](./null.sh)!

It's easier than typing `echo "..." > /dev/null` or similar commands, since [`null.sh`](./null.sh) got it wrapped. See:

```console
$ ./null.sh 'Today really sucks. Will there be someone with me?'
```

Then [`null.sh`](./null.sh) will take this command line argument and help echo it to `/dev/null`.

Amazing, isn't it? 

Come and try it whenever you want!
